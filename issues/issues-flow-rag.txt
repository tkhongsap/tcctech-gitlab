1. [Task] Prepare & Access Knowledge Base Data
Description:
Coordinate with relevant teams to identify and gather all data sources for the knowledge base, including existing documentation (FAQs, user guides, manuals), internal wikis, and (optionally) previous customer chat logs. Prepare, clean, and structure these datasets for ingestion and indexing. Determine the best ingestion method (e.g., API or bulk upload) and document the process.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	All required knowledge documents are collected and available.
•	Data is cleaned, structured, and formatted for the chosen indexing solution.
•	The data ingestion process is documented and sample payloads are provided.
Labels: data-access, knowledge-base, backend, high-priority

2. [Task] Define Knowledge Domain & Retrieval Strategies
Description:
Work with subject matter experts to define the scope of the knowledge base and identify key topics and user intents. Determine efficient and accurate retrieval strategies (keyword search, semantic search, hybrid approaches with intent recognition) and define relevance metrics for evaluating search results.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	The knowledge domain scope and key topics are clearly defined and documented.
•	Retrieval strategies and relevance metrics are agreed upon by stakeholders.
Labels: planning, knowledge-domain, retrieval, high-priority

3. [Feature] Implement Knowledge Base Indexing & Vector Database
Description:
Set up the infrastructure for indexing the knowledge base by choosing and configuring a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma). Develop an indexing pipeline that converts documents into vector embeddings using a selected embedding model (e.g., OpenAI or Hugging Face). Optimize the pipeline for search speed and recall.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	The vector database is properly set up and configured.
•	The indexing pipeline successfully processes documents and stores vector embeddings.
•	Sample queries return relevant results within acceptable response times.

4. [Feature] Build and Integrate RAG-Powered Chatbot into the Web App
Description:
Develop a RAG-powered chatbot that provides accurate, contextually relevant answers by leveraging the indexed knowledge base. Integrate this chatbot directly into your web app, ensuring a seamless user experience. Key steps include:
•	Implementing an NLP pipeline to understand and transform user queries into effective search requests.
•	Augmenting chatbot responses with retrieved knowledge base information.
•	Enabling context tracking to maintain conversation history and improve response relevance.
•	Incorporating fallback mechanisms if no relevant information is found.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	The chatbot is fully integrated into the web app and accessible via the designated support or FAQ section.
•	It processes and understands user queries, returning relevant and context-aware responses.
•	End-to-end tests confirm proper context tracking and fallback behavior.

5. [Task] Evaluate RAG Performance and Validate User Experience
Description:
Establish a process to continuously evaluate the performance of the RAG system and gather user feedback. Tasks include:
•	Defining key metrics (recall, precision, answer accuracy, user satisfaction).
•	Implementing a feedback mechanism (e.g., thumbs up/down, ratings) within the web app interface for chatbot responses.
•	Collaborating with business stakeholders to validate that the system meets user needs and business requirements.
•	Analyzing feedback and performance data to identify improvement areas and iterating on the system.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	The RAG system’s performance is regularly measured against the defined metrics.
•	A user feedback mechanism is implemented and actively collects input.
•	Iterative improvements are documented and applied based on evaluation results and stakeholder reviews.
Labels: evaluation, performance, feedback, validation, improvement
