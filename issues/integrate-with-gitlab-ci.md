# Integrate Issue Generation with GitLab CI/CD

Set up GitLab CI/CD pipeline to automatically create issues based on:

- Failed experiments or tests
- Performance regressions
- New research findings
- Weekly experiment summaries

The pipeline should scan for new markdown files and create corresponding issues.
