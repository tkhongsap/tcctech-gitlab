1. [Feature] Build Alert Generation Mechanism
Description:
Create a system to generate alerts when conditions set by the deterministic rules are met. Alerts should include relevant context (e.g., timestamp, user ID, suspected issue) and support configurable severity levels (e.g., critical, warning, info).
Acceptance Criteria:
•	Alert system triggers notifications for events that match defined rules.
•	Alerts contain sufficient metadata for quick incident triage (e.g., user ID, event type).
•	Configurable severity levels are in place for different anomaly categories.
Labels: security, alerting, backend, high-priority

2. [Task] Testing & Validation of Anomaly Detection
Description:
Perform thorough testing and validation on both the deterministic rules engine and the alert generation mechanism. Compare logged data against historical records to measure false positives/negatives, refine thresholds, and ensure system reliability.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	Tests cover a range of normal and anomalous scenarios.
•	False positive/negative rates are measured and documented.
•	Thresholds or rules are adjusted to minimize misclassification.
•	Final test results are reviewed and approved by the security team.
Labels: testing, validation, security, anomaly-detection

3. [Task] Output & Reporting
Description:
Implement an output/reporting module to present alerts and detection results. This includes a dashboard or reporting interface for security analysts to view and manage detected anomalies, plus a feedback loop for refining future rules.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	A dashboard or reporting interface displays all triggered alerts in real time.
•	Users can filter and sort alerts by severity, time, or other metadata.
•	A feedback mechanism allows analysts to mark alerts as true/false positives, feeding improvements back into the system.
