Database Performance Optimization

Our application is experiencing slow query performance on the user_activities table. We need to:

1. Add appropriate indexes for common queries
2. Implement query result caching with Redis
3. Consider partitioning the table by date
4. Archive old data (>1 year) to cold storage
5. Optimize the most expensive queries identified in slow query log

This is becoming a bottleneck for user experience and needs to be addressed soon.
