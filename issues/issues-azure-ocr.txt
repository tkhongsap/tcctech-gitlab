1. Azure OCR Integration
[Feature] Integrate Azure OCR API
•	Description: Write code to interface with the Azure OCR service to extract text from invoice images.
•	Acceptance: The integration successfully calls the API and returns raw OCR results for sample invoices.
•	Labels: azure-ocr, backend, high-priority

2. Data Extraction & Parsing
[Feature] Extract Invoice Data from OCR Results
•	Description: Develop a module to parse OCR output and extract key fields: store name, store id, tax id, transaction date, transaction time, and spending amount.
•	Acceptance: Extracted data accurately reflects invoice details from test images.
•	Labels: data-extraction, backend, high-priority
[Feature] Normalize and Process Extracted Data
•	Description: Clean and normalize the extracted data to ensure consistency (e.g., standardize date/time formats, remove noise).
•	Acceptance: Processed data is consistent and ready for conversion into JSON.
•	Labels: data-processing, backend

3. Data Conversion & Pipeline Orchestration
[Feature] Convert Processed Data to JSON
•	Description: Create a module to transform the normalized data into JSON format, adhering to a schema suitable for the mobile loyalty/point calculation app.
•	Acceptance: JSON output matches the defined schema and is validated against sample data.
•	Labels: json, backend
[Task] Implement End-to-End Data Pipeline
•	Description: Orchestrate the entire workflow from OCR extraction through data processing to JSON conversion, including error handling and logging.
•	Acceptance: The complete pipeline processes sample invoices end-to-end with reliable outputs.
•	Labels: data-pipeline, backend, high-priority

4. Deployment & Monitoring
[Task] Set Up Deployment Strategy
•	Description: Define and implement a deployment approach (e.g., Docker, cloud functions) for the OCR pipeline.
•	Acceptance: Deployment pipelines are established, documented, and tested in both development and production environments.
•	Labels: devops, deployment, infra
[Task] Implement Logging & Monitoring
•	Description: Set up logging to capture API calls, data extraction errors, and pipeline performance; integrate basic monitoring and alerting.
•	Acceptance: Logs are accessible and provide actionable insights; monitoring tools are configured and verified with test scenarios.
•	Labels: monitoring, infra
