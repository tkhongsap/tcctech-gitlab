1. [Task] Prepare & Access Required Data
Description:
Coordinate with relevant teams to obtain access to the necessary datasets, including:
•	Purchase transaction history
•	Product catalog with pricing details
•	Current promotion calendar or rules
•	Customer order history (up to the last 30 transactions)
Prepare and clean these datasets for model training and testing.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	All required datasets are available, cleaned, and formatted.
•	Sample data payloads are provided to the modeling team.
•	The data access mechanism (API or direct database access) is documented and agreed upon.
Labels: data-access, backend, high-priority

2. [Task] Confirm Recommendation Trigger Points and Business Logic
Description:
Work with business stakeholders and development teams to define:
•	When the recommendation engine should be triggered (e.g., during product selection, cart updates, or pre-checkout).
•	Whether upsell logic should strictly follow the promotion grid or allow for freestyle, behavior-based suggestions.
•	The UI placement for triggering and displaying recommendations (e.g., within the back-office order form).
Acceptance Criteria:
•	Trigger points and integration hooks are clearly defined and approved.
•	The business logic (promotion-based vs. behavior-based) is documented.
•	UI/UX requirements are confirmed for integration.

3. [Feature] Build Cross-Sell & Upsell Recommendation Model
Description:
Develop the core recommendation engine that supports both:
•	Cross-sell: Suggesting complementary products not in the cart.
•	Upsell: Recommending increased quantities or upgraded products.
The model should incorporate both promotion-based logic (e.g., “Buy 7 get 2 free”) and behavior-based logic using historical transaction data.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	The model returns relevant suggestions for both cross-sell and upsell scenarios.
•	It correctly handles cases with and without active promotions.
•	Test cases using sample data produce accurate and expected recommendations.

4. [Feature] Integrate Recommendation Engine into Admin Order Flow
Description:
Integrate the recommendation engine into the back-office order entry interface, ensuring that:
•	Recommendations are triggered in real time based on items selected.
•	Both new order entry (empty cart) and order review (existing cart) scenarios are supported.
•	Agents can view and act on the suggested recommendations within the admin UI.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	The recommendation engine is successfully integrated into the admin UI.
•	Recommendations are displayed in real time during order creation.
•	End-to-end tests with mock data confirm correct functionality.
Labels: integration, frontend, backend, order-flow

5. [Task] Validate Model Behavior with Business Users
Description:
Collaborate with business stakeholders to test and validate the recommendation outputs across various scenarios, ensuring that:
•	Sample recommendations align with the expected business strategies.
•	Rules for edge cases (e.g., over-promotion, lack of inventory) are defined and refined.
•	The model’s performance and output quality are reviewed and approved.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	Business users have reviewed and signed off on the recommendation logic.
•	Feedback is incorporated and adjustments are made as necessary.
•	The model meets the established performance criteria and aligns with the sales strategy.
Labels: validation, testing, business-review
