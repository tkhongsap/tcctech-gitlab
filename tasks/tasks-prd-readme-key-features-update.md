## Relevant Files

- `README.md` - Main documentation file that needs comprehensive restructuring and content updates
- `scripts/rename_branches.py` - Branch renaming script that needs to be documented
- `scripts/generate_executive_dashboard.py` - Executive dashboard generation script
- `scripts/send_report_email.py` - Email delivery script for reports
- `scripts/sync_issues.py` - Issue creation from files script
- `.env.example` - Example environment configuration file (may need creation/updates)
- `config/config.yaml` - Configuration file examples for documentation
- `templates/` - Directory containing issue templates and examples

### Notes

- The main focus is on updating documentation, not modifying the existing scripts
- All examples and code blocks should be tested to ensure they work correctly
- Consider creating separate example files if the README becomes too lengthy
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing documentation references
