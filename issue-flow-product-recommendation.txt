1. Architecture & Design
[Task] Define Recommendation Engine Architecture
•	Description: Draft a high-level design outlining how the engine integrates with purchase transactions, ThaiBev product data, and current promotion lists, including a collaborative filtering component for recommendation logic.
•	Acceptance: Architecture document reviewed and approved by the team.
•	Labels: architecture, design, planning

2. Data Integration
[Feature] Integrate ThaiBev Product & Promotion Data
•	Description: Develop modules to ingest and update ThaiBev beverage and food product details, along with current promotion lists from internal sources.
•	Acceptance: Data is accessible and correctly formatted for use by the recommendation engine.
•	Labels: data-integration, backend, high-priority

3. Transaction Processing
[Feature] Implement Transaction Listener
•	Description: Build a module that listens for incoming purchase transactions and determines if a recommendation should be triggered based on predefined rules.
•	Acceptance: The system triggers the recommendation process only for eligible transactions.
•	Labels: transaction, backend, high-priority

4. Recommendation Logic
[Feature] Develop MVP Recommendation Model with Collaborative Filtering
•	Description: 
o	Implement an MVP recommendation model that leverages collaborative filtering to suggest upsell or cross-sell options based on similar transaction patterns and ThaiBev promotion data.
o	Ensure that the model selectively triggers recommendations—only for transactions meeting certain criteria.
•	Acceptance: 
o	The model returns appropriate recommendations for test transactions using collaborative filtering, ensuring selective triggering.
o	Demonstrated performance improvements through historical data analysis.

5. API & Integration
[Feature] Expose Recommendation API Endpoint
•	Description: Develop and document an API endpoint that accepts transaction data and returns recommendation results, enabling integration with other products and apps.
•	Acceptance: The API is secure, documented, and returns recommendations based on sample inputs.
•	Labels: api, integration, frontend

6. Testing & Monitoring
[Task] Implement Testing and Logging
•	Description: Set up unit and integration tests for all modules. Implement logging to monitor transaction processing, recommendation outputs, and any anomalies.
•	Acceptance: All tests pass, and logs provide actionable insights for troubleshooting and performance tuning.
•	Labels: testing, logging, infra

7. Deployment
[Task] Set Up MVP Deployment Strategy
•	Description: Define and implement a deployment strategy (e.g., using Docker or cloud services) for the recommendation engine, ensuring smooth transitions between development and staging environments.
•	Acceptance: Deployment pipelines are documented and successfully tested in development and staging.
•	Labels: deployment, devops, infra
